## Roadmap & Future Vision

Build each club and member database, including current members and alumni. Implement a hierarchical permission and access system that defines roles such as executive board and management staff.

### Phase 2: Extra Features – Governance and Certificates
Introduce features for submitting and voting on club proposals, as well as issuing activity-based certificates. The properties and design of each certificate will vary depending on the member’s level of participation.

### Phase 3: Expansion to general organization 
Open the platform to external institutions and organizations. Support broader use cases including student networks, NGOs, and different institutions around the world.
